Nerstrand
=========

Nerstrand uses the standard Unix/Linux procedure for building and installtion,
'configure', 'make', and 'make install'. 


Building Nerstrand
------------------

Building Nerstrand requires a C99 compiler supporting OpenMP specification 3.0
or greater (almost all of my testing is with GCC 4.7 and 4.8) and CMake. The
configure script requires Bash, however it is possible to do the configuration
by hand. 


To build Nerstrand with the default options, execute:

    ./configure

    make


After it is built, the binary and the library will reside in
./build/[system-arch]/bin and ./build/[system-arch]/lib respectively (for most
systems, [system-arch] will be Linux-x86_64, but depends on your
OS/architecture). 



Installing Nerstrand
--------------------

Nerstrand can then be installed using: 

   make install 

The default prefix is /usr/local, but can be changed with:

   configure --prefix="my_prefix"
